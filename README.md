## ‚öíÔ∏è Installation

### Dependencies: 

For seamless playback, ensure you have either `ffplay` installed:

#### FFmpeg

##### Windows:

Download FFmpeg from the [official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add it to your system's PATH. For those unfamiliar with adding to the PATH, you might want to consult a guide or search for instructions specific to your version of Windows.

It can be installed via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):

```
choco install ffmpeg
```

Or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/):

```
scoop install ffmpeg
```

##### Linux:

For apt-based distros (like Ubuntu and Debian):

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

For users of dnf-based distros such as Fedora, you may need to enable the RPM Fusion repository first before installing FFmpeg:

```
sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
```

And then:

```
sudo dnf install ffmpeg
```

For pacman-based distros, such as Arch, you can install FFmpeg using the following command:

```
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
```

For Gentoo:

```
emerge --ask --quiet --verbose media-video/ffmpeg
```

##### macOS:

For macOS users with Homebrew installed, you can use the following command:

```
brew install ffmpeg
```

##### \*BSD:

FreeBSD:

```
pkg install ffmpeg
```

NetBSD:

```
pkg_add ffmpeg
```

OpenBSD:

```
doas pkg_add ffmpeg
```

### Installing via Go

Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed (version 1.18 or later).

To install RadioGoGo:

```bash
go install github.com/zi0p4tch0/radiogogo@latest
```

#### For Linux/macOS/\*BSD:

To make sure `radiogogo` is available in your terminal, you might need to add the Go binary path to your system's PATH:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

#### For Windows:

After installation, you might need to add the Go binary path to your system's PATH to run `radiogogo` from the Command Prompt. You can do this manually through the System Properties ‚Üí Environment Variables, or run the following in Command Prompt:

```bash
setx PATH "%PATH%;%USERPROFILE%\go\bin"
```

Now, you can launch `radiogogo` directly from your terminal or Command Prompt.

### Downloading the Binary

Navigate to the `Releases` section of the project repository. 

Find the appropriate binary for your OS, download it, and place it in your system's PATH for easy access.

## üöÄ Usage

Launch RadioGoGo by executing the following command:

```bash
radiogogo
```

### Terminals for an optimal RadioGoGo experience:

- **Windows:** For a smooth experience on Windows, consider using [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal). It offers multiple tabs, a GPU-accelerated text rendering engine, and a rich set of customization options. If you're fond of UNIX-like environments, [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) combined with Windows Terminal can be a powerful duo.

- **Linux:** On Linux, most modern terminals should work well with RadioGoGo. However, [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), a GPU-accelerated terminal, and [Terminator](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html), known for its flexibility, stand out as exceptional choices. Both offer great performance and customization options to enhance your TUI experience.

- **macOS:** On macOS, while the default Terminal.app should work fine, you might want to explore [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) for its advanced features, superior performance, and extensive customization options. iTerm2's integration with macOS makes it a preferred choice for many users.

## Configuration

**Config File Location:**
- **Windows:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\radiogogo\config.yaml`
- **Other Platforms:** `~/.config/radiogogo/config.yaml`

It gets created automatically when you launch the app for the first time.

### üé® Customizing App Theme

Personalize the look of RadioGoGo to match your style! 

The application supports theme customization, which allows you to change various color attributes to give the TUI a fresh appearance.

The configuration file is automatically created when the app is launched for the first time if it doesn't already exist.

**Default Theme Configuration:**
```yaml
theme:
    textColor: '#ffffff'
    primaryColor: '#5a4f9f'
    secondaryColor: '#8b77db'
    tertiaryColor: '#4e4e4e'
    errorColor: '#ff0000'
```

Adjust the color values in the configuration to your liking and relaunch the app to see the changes take effect.

Here's another theme configuration to give you an idea of how you can customize the app's appearance:

```yaml
theme:
    textColor: '#f0e6e6'
    primaryColor: '#c41230'
    secondaryColor: '#e4414f'
    tertiaryColor: '#f58b8d'
    errorColor: '#ff0000'
```

## ü§î FAQ

### I selected a radio station but there's no audio. What's happening?
Upon selecting a station, the duration to initiate playback can vary based on the stream's origin and its server location.
In some cases, the playback is immediate, while in others, it might necessitate a brief buffering period. 
It's analogous to the latency encountered with various online services ‚Äì certain connections are swift, while others require a momentary lag. 
If you don't experience instant audio, I recommend waiting a few seconds. 
The broadcast is likely en route to your terminal.

### Why do some stations not work at all?
Due to the dynamic nature of radio stations, some might go offline or change their streaming endpoints. 
Currently, RadioGoGo doesn't have a feature to report or hide these non-functioning stations. 
However, I am actively aware of this challenge and am planning to introduce a feature in future releases to enhance this aspect of the user experience. 

### How do I adjust the volume in RadioGoGo?
Volume controls in RadioGoGo are set before initiating playback. This is because the volume level is passed as a command line argument to `ffplay`. As of now, once the playback has started, adjusting the volume within RadioGoGo isn't supported. To change the volume during an ongoing playback, you'd have to stop (`ctrl+k`) and restart the stream.
